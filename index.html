  <p>About Me:</p>  
  <p> I am a computer science student at Santa Monica College. I am almost finished with my associates degree and I am planning to transfer to a 4 year university this year, in order to obtain my bachelors degree. I have taken class on C++, Java and Python and because of that I have a rudimentary understanding of these languuages.</p> 
  <p> As you can tell by my crude portfolio website my knowledge on css,javascript, and html is very minimal and was basically nothing prior to this week.</p>  
  <p> However, I hope I can be admitted into your prestigous program so I can hone my html, css, and javascript skills. </p>
